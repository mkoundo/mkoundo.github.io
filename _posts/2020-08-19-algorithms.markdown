[Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) - An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people by Aditya Y. Bhargava (2016)

 I really enjoyed this introductory text on algorithms. The algorithm descriptions are conveyed via numerous examples and reinforced with exercises. The topics covered include:
 
 - Binary Search & Big O notation
 - Selection sort, arrays, linked lists
 - Recursion
 - Quicksort
 - Hash Tables (aka dictionaries)
 - Breadth First Search
 - Dijkstra's Algorithm
 - Greedy Algorithms
 - Dynamic Programming
 - K-nearest neighbours
