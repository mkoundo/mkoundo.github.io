As a beginner's introduction to python, I completed [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/), which includes free lecture notes, exercises (inc. solutions) and youtube lectures by Nick Parlante. Although this course is ten years old and is based on legacy python2, I still highly recommend it. Most of it is still applicable to python3. The topics covered include:

- Python setup
- Python intro
- Strings
- Lists
- Sorting
- Dicts & Files
- Regular Expressions
- Utilities (Files, external processes and url parsing)

I'm on windows 10 and since I already had MX Linux installed in virtualbox, I completed the course in there. MX includes python2 and 3 straight out of the box so it was quick to get going. All coding was done in Geany.
