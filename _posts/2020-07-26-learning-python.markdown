excerpt: Beginner's introduction to Python

As a beginner's introduction to python, I completed [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/), which includes free lecture notes, exercises (inc. solutions) and youtube lectures by Nick Parlante. Although this course is ten years old and is based on legacy python2, I still highly recommend it. Most of it is still applicable to python3. The topics covered include:

- Python setup
- Python intro
- Strings
- Lists
- Sorting
- Dicts & Files
- Regular Expressions
- Utilities (Files, external processes and url parsing)
