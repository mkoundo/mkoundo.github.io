### Google's Python Class - A Crash Course in Python 2
As a beginner's introduction to python, I completed [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/), which includes free lecture notes, exercises (inc. solutions) and youtube lectures by Nick Parlante. Although this course is ten years old and is based on legacy python2, I still highly recommend it. Most of it is still applicable to python3. The topics covered include:

- Python setup
- Python intro
- Strings
- Lists
- Sorting
- Dicts & Files
- Regular Expressions
- Utilities (Files, external processes and url parsing)

### Automating the Boring Stuff with Python - An introductory Python 3 Course

[Automating the boring stuff](http://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart. 

A beginner's guide to python. My github repository is [here](https://github.com/mkoundo/Automate_the_Boring_Stuff).
Unfortunately it lacks material on object oriented programming. Corey Schafer's excellent [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc) on classes addresses this shortcoming.

- Chapter 0 – Introduction
- Chapter 1 – Python Basics
- Chapter 2 – Flow Control
- Chapter 3 – Functions
- Chapter 4 – Lists
- Chapter 5 – Dictionaries and Structuring Data
- Chapter 6 – Manipulating Strings
- Chapter 7 – Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions
- Chapter 8 – Input Validation
- Chapter 9 – Reading and Writing Files
