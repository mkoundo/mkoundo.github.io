### Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib

An introduction to Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib is available on Corey Schafer's [channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS) and provides a great overview of the subject, using jupyter notebooks.

Another great resource I belatedly came across is the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas. 

Exercises for this subject are available from Guilherme Samora's [github page](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises) and includes solutions. The exercises include:

1. Getting
2. Filtering & Sorting
3. Grouping
4. Apply
5. Merge
6. Stats
7. Graphs (matplotlib & seaborn)
8. Series & Dataframes
9. Time series
10. Deleting
